requires speech_recognition and socket

Python:
This script is a UDP-based speech recognition server implemented in Python. It listens for incoming audio file paths on port 6000, performs speech recognition on the corresponding audio files, and sends the recognized text to a server on port 6001.
When a client sends an audio file path to the server, the script loads the audio file, uses the speech_recognition library to perform speech recognition on the audio data, and prints the recognized text. It then sends the recognized text to a separate server on port 6001.
The script is designed to be flexible and can handle various audio file formats supported by the speech_recognition library, such as WAV or FLAC. If the specified audio file is not found, an appropriate error message is displayed.
This script can be useful in scenarios where speech recognition needs to be performed on audio files received via UDP packets. It can be adapted and extended to suit specific requirements, such as integrating with speech-to-text applications or building voice-controlled systems.

Godot:
This GDScript is a client-side implementation for a speech-to-text application using UDP communication in the Godot game engine.
The script extends the Node3D class and is named SpeechToText. It contains a PacketPeerUDP object named socket for sending UDP packets and a UDPServer object named server for listening to UDP responses.
In the _ready function, the script executes a Python script called "speech_to_text.py" using the OS.execute method. This Python script is expected to run separately and handle the speech recognition process.
The script sets the destination address of the socket to "127.0.0.1" (localhost) and port 6000, which is assumed to be the server's address for receiving audio file paths. It also configures the server to listen on port 6001 to receive responses from the server.
The recognize_file function is used to send a file path to the server. It takes an optional parameter path, which defaults to a specific file path. The file path is converted to an ASCII buffer and sent as a UDP packet using socket.put_packet().
In the _physics_process function, the script polls the server to check for incoming responses. If a connection is available, it retrieves the connected peer using server.take_connection(). It then gets the packet received from the peer using peer.get_packet(). The received data is printed using packet.get_string_from_utf8().
This GDScript acts as a client that sends audio file paths to the server for speech recognition and receives the recognized text as a response. It provides a basic structure for integrating a speech-to-text functionality within the Godot game engine.
